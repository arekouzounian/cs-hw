# HW3 Arek Ouzounian

I have tested this as much as I could and it has had no memory leaks.
It has also passed all provided tests, but it sometimes will timeout on one of the tests despite hours of debugging.
At the end of the day, I already used up one of my extension days, so I'm just going to submit it as-is and hope that any deductions I might have from auto grading will be insignificant in the broader scope of the grade. 

Have a great day.
